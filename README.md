# ISL-Translator-Arduino101
This is arduino 101 International Sign Language Translator Glove Project

This is just the prototype of the project.

It has been done with 2 Flex Sensors and Arduino 101(since it has built-in BLE and Gyro/Accel Sensor)

The translated versions of each sign goes to Blynk App through BLE. Further thoughts: It is designed in a way that people will be able to contribute to this open source project. And have an online library with many signs.
